# Cross Industry Solution - SecureVPC - TIC code

This solution is being created to serve any kind of deployment that needs a multi tier secured VPC with best practices applied directly in the architecture and explained below

# Requirements

There are no special requirements to implement this solution as it is one of the basic building blocks of the cloud infrastructure
However, you need some basic requirements:

## Standard Requirements
     - Tencent Cloud Account
     - local terraform: https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html
     - a code editor: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

# Components

 ## VPC
    - The VPC is a standard Tencent Cloud network component which creates an isolated network in the Customer account
    - It can be deployed in any region
    - Only 1 CIDR will be associated with it, in our implementation case will be a /16
 ## Subnets
    - The subnet is a logical segregation of the VPC CIDR which can be handled separately
    - The subnet is uniquely mapped to an Availability Zone
    - Route Tables and Network ACL can be associated with the subnet (one of each)
    - In our implementation example the subnets will take a /24 IP subnet from the VPC CIDR
    - The main feature of the subnet is that it can represent an application TIER (or section) and in our example we will have 3 tiers created: Public, Service and Data
 ## Network ACLs (not included yet in the code)
    - The ACLs are a stateless rule sets that associate themselves at subnet level only and can apply TCP Layer 4 rules for inbound and outbound
    - In our case the NACL will make sure the traffic in each tier conforms to the tier functioning rules
 ## Security Groups
    - This service ensures security at object level (e.g CVM) where can be associated.
    - The SG can have as source the IP range or another security group, enabling objects associated with that security group to be used as source for another rule entry
    - In our case we will have multiple Security Groups, each created for each individual CVM type/function. For example, a database in the DATA subnet will have a security group associated, named sg_database which will allow MySql port (3306) from the source sg_service, a security group which is associated with the CVMs in the SERVICE subnet
 ## Route tables
    - The route table instances are also associated with the Subnet and they provide a way to control the traffic flow inside the VPC, up to the exit point
    - In our case, we shall have 3 route tables each associated with itâ€™s own tier. This ensures that there is traffic flow security and granularity. The main goal is not to allow public traffic to flow into data subnet
 ## NAT Gateway
    - This component will perform source address translation SNAT for the CVMs inside the VPC to ensure their access to internet services
 ## EIP
    - A payable resource that will be associated to the NAT Gateway and provide the source for the outbound internet traffic

# Deployment

This solution can be deployed with Tencent Infrastructure as Code (TIC) - https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/tic
Alternatively, you can add the provider section and deploy with Terraform
